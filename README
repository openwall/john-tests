This is supposed to reside *in* a John the Ripper tree. That is, if you
have this structure for john:

john/
john/src
john/run

...this Test Suite should reside in:

john/test


So when checking out this from GitHub, you would:

cd john
git clone https://github.com/magnumripper/jtrTestSuite.git test

To perform the test:

cd test
./jtrts.pl

To avoid a -test=0 run (that won't work well with GPU formats) within TS, run it with -noprelim option. Eg:

./jtrts.pl -noprelim ssha-opencl

The -passthru option can be used to select platform:

./jtrts.pl -noprelim -passthru "-plat=1" opencl
